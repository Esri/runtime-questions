# runtime-questions
Welcome to the 2015 Esri Developer Summit and the session called, "Everything (or Anything) You Wanted to Know About the ArcGIS Runtime SDKs but Were Afraid to Ask"

This is a YOU session. The content comes from you, the audience. The first part of this session is spent collecting and recording as many questions as possible, as quickly as possible, no answers are given during this time. The rest of the session is about answering each question. The questions are handled one-by-one by a panel made up of Esri developers from the ArcGIS Runtime team. It’s that simple! No question is out of bounds, no question is “dumb”, no question is too technical, no judgments are made. Just an informative time of interaction between you, the developer, and the ArcGIS Runtime development team.

Here's how it works:
Before the session begins and/or during the first 10 minutes of the session, submit your questions by creating issues in this repo. Fast and furious. Then, a member of the panel will take 2 minutes or so to answer a selected question from the issues list. If the session comes to an end before your submission is addressed, have no fear. In the days to follow, the team will be sure to address each and every one of your questions. You will continue to have access to this repo for an extented period of time.

So, let's get started!
